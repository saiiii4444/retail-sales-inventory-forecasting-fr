# Notebooks

This folder is a placeholder for your own exploratory notebooks. Use it to
experiment with different analyses, build quick charts, or try out models
before refining them into scripts and reports. You can create Jupyter
notebooks here (e.g. `analysis.ipynb`) or plain Python scripts. Remember
to keep sensitive data out of the repository if you plan to share it
publicly.
