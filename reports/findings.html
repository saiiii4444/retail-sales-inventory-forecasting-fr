  <h1>Findings and Reflections</h1>
  <p>
    In this short write‑up, I summarise what I saw in the numbers. Please note that the data is synthetic,
    so these trends are just examples intended for learning purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Revenue leaders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When I compared store performance, a few outlets stood out. Stores&nbsp;09, 01 and 08 consistently brought
      in more revenue than the others. They sold more units and generated higher turnover week after week.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the product side, items like Product&nbsp;040, 035 and 001 were on top. These products benefited from strong
      demand and relatively higher prices, which drove their revenue up.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Demand patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Plotting weekly or monthly totals revealed a clear seasonal rhythm. Peaks often showed up towards the end of
      each quarter. In a real business, these spikes might correspond to holiday promotions or pay‑day shopping sprees.
    </li>
    <li>
      The trend lines for the different stores looked similar overall, but some locations started from a higher
      baseline. That suggests local differences in foot traffic or management.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Inventory considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I noticed a few products with high sales volumes but modest stock on hand. In a real environment, these would
      need quick replenishment to avoid stock‑outs.
    </li>
    <li>
      I also spotted the opposite problem: items sitting with lots of inventory but not selling much. To free up cash,
      you might mark down those products or bundle them with popular items.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ideas for next steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To go further, I would build simple forecasting models that project sales into the next quarter based on past
      trends. A moving average or a basic seasonal model could be a good start.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adding store locations and regional data would help compare performance across different areas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, bringing in promotional calendars, pricing changes or marketing campaigns would make it easier to
      explain why sales go up or down.
    </li>
  </ul>
