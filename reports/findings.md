## Personal reflections and findings

In this short write‑up, I summarise what I saw in the numbers. Please note
that the data is synthetic, so these trends are just examples intended
for learning purposes.

### Revenue leaders

- When I compared store performance, a few outlets stood out. Stores 09,
  01 and 08 consistently brought in more revenue than the others. They
  sold more units and generated higher turnover week after week.
- On the product side, items like Product 040, 035 and 001 were on top.
  These products benefited from strong demand and relatively higher
  prices, which drove their revenue up.

### Demand patterns

- Plotting weekly or monthly totals revealed a clear seasonal rhythm.
  Peaks often showed up towards the end of each quarter. In a real
  business, these spikes might correspond to holiday promotions or
  pay‑day shopping sprees.
- The trend lines for the different stores looked similar overall, but
  some locations started from a higher baseline. That suggests local
  differences in foot traffic or management.

### Inventory considerations

- I noticed a few products with high sales volumes but modest stock on
  hand. In a real environment, these would need quick replenishment to
  avoid stock‑outs.
- I also spotted the opposite problem: items sitting with lots of
  inventory but not selling much. To free up cash, you might mark down
  those products or bundle them with popular items.

### Ideas for next steps

- To go further, I would build simple forecasting models that project
  sales into the next quarter based on past trends. A moving average or
  a basic seasonal model could be a good start.
- Adding store locations and regional data would help compare
  performance across different areas.
- Finally, bringing in promotional calendars, pricing changes or
  marketing campaigns would make it easier to explain why sales go up or
  down.
